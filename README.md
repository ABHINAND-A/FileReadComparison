Approach 2 is generally better. Here are the reasons:

Atomicity: Approach 2 combines the file opening and reading into a single try block. This ensures that the file's existence and readability are checked atomically, reducing the chance of a race condition where the file might be deleted or moved between the check and the actual read operation.

Pythonic Style: Approach 2 follows the EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) principle, which is a common Pythonic style. This approach tries to perform the operation and catches exceptions if they occur, rather than checking preconditions before attempting the operation.

Performance: Approach 2 avoids the additional system call (os.path.exists) to check for the file's existence, making it slightly more efficient.

Suggested Improvements
Resource Management: Both approaches should use a context manager (with statement) to ensure the file is properly closed after reading, which is already implemented in the examples.

Error Handling: Besides FileNotFoundError, other exceptions like PermissionError should also be handled to make the function more robust.

Type Hinting: Adding type hints improves code readability and helps with static analysis.

Logging: Adding logging can help in debugging and understanding issues when the file read fails.

Here's the improved code:


import os
from typing import Optional

def get_contents_approach_1(fname: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Read the contents of a file if it exists, otherwise return None."""
    if os.path.exists(fname):
        try:
            with open(fname, 'r') as f:
                return f.read()
        except (PermissionError, OSError) as e:
            print(f"Error reading file {fname}: {e}")
            return None
    else:
        return None

def get_contents_approach_2(fname: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Read the contents of a file, handling file not found and permission errors."""
    try:
        with open(fname, 'r') as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
    except (PermissionError, OSError) as e:
        print(f"Error reading file {fname}: {e}")
        return None
